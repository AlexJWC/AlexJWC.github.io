#### Album Review

> **Tommy**, "Tommy", the double-album released on May 23rd 1969 in the UK by the famous rock band The Who , introduced a new genre to the world——Rock Opera.
>The album was mostly composed by the guitarist Peter Townshend. It told the life story of Tommy Walker, who suffered from childhood's misery and later became a spiritual leader but was overthrown because of his tyranny. The album was turned into a film 6 years later, with the original casts of the band members.
>"Tommy's operatic pretensions were so transparent that for years it seemed safe to guess that Townshend's musical ideas would never catch up with his lyrics." Said the music journalist Richie Unterberger.
