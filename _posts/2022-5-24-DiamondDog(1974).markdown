#### Album Review

> **Diamond Dogs**, released 48 years ago on this day by David Bowie.

It was Bowie’s final album in the glam rock genre, also influenced by funk and soul music. The album was cited as a great influence on punk revolution at that time.

Preceded by the lead single “Rebel Rebel” , the album peaked at No.1 in the UK and No.5 in the US.
